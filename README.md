# Exploring Mental Prototypes by an Efficient Interdisciplinary Approach: Interactive Microbial Genetic Algorithm (IMGA)
This is the official implementation of [IMGA](https://yansen0508.github.io/Interactive-Microbial-Genetic-Algorithm/).

For more information please refer to our [paper](https://hal.science/hal-04050608/document).

## Requirements
Please install pytorch, torchvision and psychopy.
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Code
The generator is based on [GANimation](https://github.com/albertpumarola/GANimation).

The code will be uploaded soon...
